Web Application Security Testing – OWASP Juice Shop

As part of Task 1 in the Future Interns Cyber Security Internship, I conducted a hands-on security assessment on a deliberately vulnerable web application — OWASP Juice Shop — to simulate real-world attack scenarios and defensive analysis.

🎯 Target Application:
OWASP Juice Shop

🛠 Tools & Environment:
• Browser Developer Tools
• Burp Suite
• OWASP ZAP
• Kali Linux

🚨 Key Vulnerabilities Identified:
• SQL Injection leading to authentication bypass
• Reflected XSS via unsanitized user input
• Stored XSS affecting persistent application components
• Broken Authentication due to weak password policies
• Sensitive Data Exposure through insecure local storage

📌 What this task helped me master:
• Practical web application security testing workflows
• Deep understanding of OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
• Ethical hacking mindset — from reconnaissance to exploitation and remediation
• Translating findings into actionable security recommendations
